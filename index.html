								<h2><strong>Ideation Process</strong><br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>For this project I had decided to scrap my idea from project 1 and then create a new idea for project 2. This was because my project 1 was slightly too challenging to create a prototype for and was lacking in material. However when coming up with concepts, I did consider trying to use my project 1 material. A couple ideas that I had were as followed. </p>

							<p> September 1st 2020 </p>

							<p> 1. Using a disco ball as a "helmet" that acts as a social media platform for individual homes due to COVID-19 so that families can communicate through video chat using a 3d image. </p>

							<p> 2. Create a new phone application targeted at the older generations to teach them how to use their cellphones. This would use wireframes and create a working prototype video. </p>

							<p> 3. Using the disco balls in the first assignment to create a gallery presentation that instead of having a video about the internet playing, uses hyper reality that the user can play games with, do a quiz, take a photo, etc. </p>

							<p> 4. Create an application that uses hyper reality in retail where your phone can take a photo of any object anywhere and it will tell you how much it costs and where to buy it.</p>

							<p> 5. Go off my first initial idea of the disco ball gallery and use 3d rendering and potentially animation to create a mock-up gallery scene.</p>

								<h2><strong>Final Decision</strong><br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p> September 8th 2020 </p>

							<p> Through this iteration process, I have decided to go with option 2 and create a new application designed for the older generation who struggle to use their cellphones. The application will be for iphones only and contain a range of different options such as games to test your phone function knowledge, AR simulation to teach them (which would be included as part of the games), settings to adjust the phones font, sound, etc. and tutorials to teach them. I will use the program JustInMind to create a mock up interactive prototype.</p>

							<p> This project will help start a discussion about how techology is becoming less and less accessible for those who struggle. It is becoming increasingly difficult for people to learn these new skills as new technology advances are happening daily. As a society we cannot leave these older generations without technology skills and it is our responsibility as the "tech generation" to aid and help whereever we can. </p>


							<p>I will start my project with gathering resources such as creating personas, wireframes and getting inspiration. </p>

						<p> I created these two different personas that I have used as a way to get a better understanding of what my target audience is. I used 1 thats slightly older and 1 that is slightly younger to get a broad range of perspectives. I will use these personas when designing my wireframes and my initial prototype.</p>

						<h2>Prototyping</h2>
					</header>

					<p> September 21st 2020 </p>

					<p>I then began prototyping using JustInMind software. Whilst prototyping I originally had the below format for my design, but after careful consideration and ideation I adjusted some of these aspects. The first image shows the 1st prototype. However, i found the font was too large and aggressive, the buttons at the bottom were also too large and looked silly. The actual yellow buttons were also too large and looked uneasy on the eyes. I then adjusted these changes where the final design output looked like the second image. This design is a lot more clean and precise. The font is thinner and the added orange ties the colours together. The final image shows what this page looks like on the actual iphone screen, which you can see looks a lot better than the original design. </p>

					<p><strong> First design:</strong> </p>

					<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/p1.png">
									</div>

									<p><strong> Final design: </strong> </p>

									<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/p2.png">
								</div>

								<p><strong> Actual on-screen final design: </strong> </p>

									<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/p3.png">

				</div>

				<p><strong> Final Features</strong> </p>

				<p> Once the final design output was complete, I then went through and added the final small details to make the application look complete. These small details is what gives more depth to the design and help the user feel like the prototype is closer to the real thing. I firstly added in some back buttons as i realised this was missing in the tutorial / game sections and would make navigating the application a lot easier. </p>

				<p><strong> Added back button: </strong></p>

				<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/back.png">
									</div>

				<p><strong> Logo & name Creation: </strong> </p>
				<p> I then also created a logo and name for the application. I came up with "SeniorCell" as my final option after brainstorming various different options. I created a quick simple "s" "c" logo on illustrator and added this into my log in button and a small version on each page. This once again helps make the prototype feel a lot more real. </p>

				<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/logo2.png">
									</div>

 				<p> <strong> Iphone home page </strong> </p>
 				<p> I then also added in an additional page as the iphone home page. This will be the first page when the prototype is simulated and on it you can see my app "SeniorCell" with the logo. This helps give the prototype further development and aids in making it feel real. </p>

 				<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/home.png">
									</div>

				<p> <strong> Progress page data </strong> </p>
				<p> I also created some fake data statistics for the example in the prototype on illustrator to give the user a better understanding of what sort of information would be in this area. 

				<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/pie.png">
									</div>

				<div class="g-row">
									<div class="g-70">
									<img src="images/progress1.png">
									</div>

						<h2>Final Prototype</h2>
					</header>
					<p>September 9th 2020</p>
					<section>

					</section>

					<p> My final prototype was created in the form of a video using voice over audio and a screen-recording of my final design all put together on premier pro. This Final video can be seen below. I have attached the final prototype vp file on my journal on blackboard. </p>

					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaeP3RZV0T0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
						
					</iframe>

					<p> Reflecting on this project, it was definitely originally really hard to come up with a concpet since I was really torn on the ideas and passionate about so many, but in the end i was really happy with my final output, but just wish there was a better way to upload a high quality prototype that people can interact with, not just me. I wish if i had extra time that i could somehow post this prototype into a work space for people to play around with and interact with. </p>
